# HAUL

**Paste a URL. Get the best available media. Nothing else.**

HAUL is a privacy-first CLI tool for downloading publicly accessible media
from Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, Pinterest, TikTok, and Facebook — always at
the best quality the source actually exposes, with a clean output structure
and no accounts, tracking, or ads.

```
$ haul https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cx1234567/

```

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .          # from a clone of this repo
# or, once published:
pip install haul-cli
```

Requires **Python 3.10+**. A system install of
**[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)** on your `PATH` is recommended
but optional: some platforms (notably YouTube at 1080p and above) serve
video and audio as separate streams that need FFmpeg to combine. If FFmpeg
isn't installed, HAUL automatically falls back to the best quality that
already includes audio, with a note explaining why:

```
⚠ FFmpeg not found — using 720p (audio included) instead of 1080p (would need FFmpeg to merge audio).
```

It only fails outright if no audio-included quality exists at all — and it
checks this *before* downloading anything, not after. `--audio` on a
platform with no standalone audio stream also needs FFmpeg, to extract the
audio track from a downloaded video.

## Usage

```bash
# Single URL — downloads the best available quality
haul https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

# Multiple URLs at once (processed concurrently)
haul https://instagram.com/reel/abc https://reddit.com/r/x/comments/y

# From a text file, one URL per line (# comments allowed)
haul --file urls.txt

# Cap the quality instead of always taking the best
haul -q 1080p https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

# Audio only
haul --audio https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

# Custom output directory
haul -o ~/Downloads/clips https://tiktok.com/@user/video/123

# Write a JSON metadata sidecar next to the file
haul --metadata https://reddit.com/r/x/comments/y

# A profile picture instead of a post (Instagram only for now)
haul --profile https://instagram.com/example

# Custom filename template
haul --filename "{author}_{title}.{ext}" https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

# Non-interactive batch runs
haul --file urls.txt --skip-existing   # never prompt, never overwrite
haul --file urls.txt --force           # never prompt, always overwrite
```

Run `haul --help` for the full flag reference.

### Output structure

```
downloads/
├── instagram/
│   └── example/
│       ├── instagram_example_cx1234567.mp4
│       └── instagram_example_cx1234567.json   (with --metadata)
├── youtube/
│   └── creator/
│       └── youtube_creator_dqw4w9wgxcq.mp4
```

### Duplicate files

HAUL never silently overwrites a file. If the destination already exists:

- In an interactive terminal with a single URL, you're prompted:
  **[1] Skip [2] Overwrite [3] Rename**.
- In a batch run (multiple URLs, `--file`, or non-interactive), it defaults
  to **skip** — the safe choice — unless you pass `--force` or
  `--skip-existing` explicitly.

### Config file

HAUL works with zero configuration. To set your own defaults, copy
[`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml) to `~/.config/haul/config.toml`:

```toml
output = "~/Downloads/haul"
quality = "best"
metadata = false
concurrency = 3
```

Any CLI flag always overrides the config file.

HAUL only ever reads **publicly accessible** content. It never logs in,
never bypasses a login wall, and never touches DRM-protected media — if a
post is private, you'll get a clear error, not a workaround.

## Architecture

```

├── config.py                # optional ~/.config/haul/config.toml
├── core/
│   ├── detector.py          # URL validation + platform routing
│   ├── registry.py          # maps a URL to the right extractor
│   ├── extractor.py         # MediaInfo / MediaFormat / Extractor
│   ├── selector.py          # quality ranking — never upscales
│   ├── downloader.py        # streaming, resume, atomic writes, FFmpeg
│   ├── metadata.py          # optional JSON sidecar writer
│   ├── pipeline.py          # wires the above together per URL
│   └── errors.py            # one exception hierarchy, human-readable
├── extractors/
│   ├── _shared.py           # yt-dlp adapter -> HAUL's MediaInfo model
│   ├── instagram.py, youtube.py, reddit.py,

└── utils/
    ├── filenames.py          # sanitization + templating, no path traversal

```

Every layer only knows about the layer below it: extractors never touch the
filesystem, the selector never touches the network, and the downloader never
knows what platform a URL came from. Adding a platform means writing one
file in `extractors/` and registering it in
`core/registry.build_default_registry()` — nothing else changes.

### Why yt-dlp as the extraction engine

Six platforms means six different private, unversioned front-end APIs, each
with its own anti-bot measures and signed-URL schemes that change without
notice. Hand-rolling that from scratch would be fragile, would need
constant reverse-engineering, and would start to look less like "read a
public page" and more like "circumvent a platform's protections" — which is
explicitly out of scope for this tool.

**yt-dlp** already solves exactly this problem, for exactly these platforms,
and does so by reading public pages — it doesn't authenticate, and it
doesn't touch DRM. HAUL uses it strictly as a *discovery* engine
(`skip_download=True` — it only asks "what formats exist?"). Every other
guarantee in this spec — resumable/atomic downloads, retry logic, quality
selection, output structure, filename safety, duplicate handling — is
HAUL's own code in `core/`, not yt-dlp's. If you'd rather see raw
per-platform scrapers, `extractors/_shared.py` is the one place that would
need to change; the rest of the architecture doesn't care how extraction
happens.

## Testing

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

- `tests/test_selector.py` — quality ranking, including the never-upscale rule
- `tests/test_filenames.py` — sanitization and path-traversal safety
- `tests/test_detector.py` — URL validation and platform routing
- `tests/test_downloader.py` — real streaming/resume/atomic-write behavior
  against a local HTTP server (no mocking of `requests`)
- `tests/test_pipeline.py` — full pipeline wiring with fake extractor/downloader
- `tests/test_config.py`, `tests/test_errors.py` — config loading, error rendering
- `tests/extractors/test_supports.py` — each extractor's URL-matching logic
- `tests/test_regressions.py` — one test per bug found in the wild; add to
  this file whenever a platform quirk breaks something

## Known limitations

- **Instagram profile pictures** are read by pattern-matching Instagram's
  public HTML, since yt-dlp doesn't expose that field. Instagram's markup
  changes without notice, so this is best-effort — if it stops working,
  see `extractors/instagram.py:extract_profile_picture`.
- **Live streams, Stories, and age/login-gated content** are out of scope —
  HAUL only downloads content a platform serves without authentication.
- Extraction correctness for any given platform is only as good as the
  installed `yt-dlp` version. If a platform changes its page structure and
  extraction starts failing, `pip install -U yt-dlp` first.

## Non-goals

HAUL deliberately does **not**: log in or use cookies/sessions, download
private or authenticated content, circumvent DRM or platform security
measures, batch-scrape entire accounts, or edit/transcode video beyond the
audio extraction and audio/video muxing needed to assemble a single
already-selected quality tier.
